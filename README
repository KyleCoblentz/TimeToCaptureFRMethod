This repository contains code and data associated with the Coblentz and DeLong manuscript 'Estimating predator functional repsonses
using the times between prey captures'. This repository contains two main folders: 'Code for Simulations' and 'Jumping Spider data and code
for analysis'.

'Code for Simulations' contains R code for simulating data sets of the times between prey captures of a predator given values of the 
predator's space clearance rate and handling times. It also contains code for analyzing these simulated data sets using either
Bayesian or Maximum Likelihood methods. Using this code, one can determine how well the time-to-capture method is likely to work to
estimate predator functional responses in their system with a guess of the neighborhood in which their predator's space clearance rate
and handling time is in.

'Jumping Spider data and code for analysis' contains the jumping spider data analyzed in the manscript and code to fit functional responses
to the data in either a Bayesian or Maximum Likelihood framework. This code should provide a template for fitting functional responses to 
time-to-capture data.
