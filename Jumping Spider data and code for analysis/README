This folder contains data on the time between prey captures for two Bold Jumping Spiders and code to use that data to estimate their
functional responses in both a maximum likelihood and Bayesian framework. This data is associated with the Coblentz and DeLong manuscript
'Estimating predator functional responses using the times between feeding events'.
