This folder contains code to simulate time-to-capture data and to analyze that data. This can be used to determine
whether or not the time-to-capture method is likely to work for a particular system and to set expectations on how 
well the method is likely to be able to estimate functional response parameters given ball park estimates of what 
the functional response parameters are likely to be for a given predator.
